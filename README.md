# Demo Page

## Start locally

```
npm run dev
```

## Setup in Netlify

The build configuration is done via [netlify.toml](/netlify.toml).
I had to set the the staging branch as a Branch deploy in the UI, though.

## Deploy

Just push to the repository's main branch. It's linked with netlify, which
triggers a build/deploy.
